# Assignment 01

Create a pure NodeJS server that can handle a GET call, pull the data from the db.json and send it to the provided front end. You don't have to render everything, 3-4 properties are quite enough.

Bonus 01: Upgrade the server so it also handles a POST request. You need to create a user on the front end, handle the POST request on the back end, and save that new user in db.json. There is no need to create a user with all the properties that the users have in the database. It's enough to have the same ones that you render on the front end.

# Assignment 02

Create the same server handling a GET request using Express. Same "rules" apply as the first assignment.

Bonus 01: Upgrade the server to also handle a POST request, same as the first assignment, but this time using Express.
