Create an MVC ExpressJS application for a Rent-a-car business. 

1. The API needs to have a route to fetch all cars from the database 
2. The API needs to have a route to fetch a single car by ID from the database 
3. The API needs to have a route to create new cars in the database 
4. The API needs to have a route to delete cars from the database 
5. The API needs to have a route to update a car in the database 
6. The API should be able to accept a pageSize query param that limits the number of cars it should return. (An update to #1 in the workshop) 
7. The API should be able to accept a brand queryParam that allows the user to get cars from that brand only. (Bonus points if you manage to make it work alongside #6) Don't worry about finishing everything today.
