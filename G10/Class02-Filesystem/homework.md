# Filesystem Homework

## Basic Requirements

1. Initialize a new npm project and create an `index.js` file.
2. Using the fs module create a new file called homework.txt
3. Create a path to the file using the `path` module
4. Inside the file write the following "Homework 02 in Basic Node"
5. Append to the file the following " FINISHED!"
6. Read the file contents and print them out in the console.

- Don't forget to add a .gitignore file in your project as always.

## Bonus (OPTIONAL)

1. Using the task service code from class, create a function called `editTask` that will allow you to edit the task property of the task you have selected (the text of the task)
2. Add an `owner` property to all the tasks and create function getTasksByOwner which will return all the tasks by that owner's name
3. Create a `deleteAll` function for the task service which will delete all the tasks currently in `tasks.json`

*Remember everyone that these homeworks are not meant for you to pass Basic Node or anything like that, this is for you to practice and get comfortable with the conceps as we go along, go into the code from yesterday, edit it, change stuff around, test out the file system and all the different functions.*

*This homework is due in 7 days so next friday 18th of March*
