# Events Homework

Before doing this homework you have to finish the homework for the HTTP module. 

1. Create a logger.js file that will have an event called `server-started` that will only run ONCE when the server you build is started.
2. Add events to logger.js that will track two things in a .json or .txt file, one is only GET requests and the other thing is only POST requests. (very similar to what with did in class just with a minor tweak)
3. Implement an original custom event in the server of your choosing, be creatvie, experiment and surprise us!

As usual try to finish this homework in a week, so next friday is the due date.
