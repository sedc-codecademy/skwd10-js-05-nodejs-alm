 * There is a better way of handling/creting cookies =)
 * We can create a session:
 * And this session will GENERATE THE COOKIE FOR US =);
 *
 * 1. express-session => generetes cookie for us, and it saves it in the browser/client.
 * SESSION DATA is not saved in the cookie itself, just the session ID
 * SESSION DATA is stored on the SERVER-SIDE
 * We would not longer need cookie-parser :)
 * If we have a DB we can store the session inside this DB =) thanks to express-session
 *
 *
 * 2. cookie-session => generetes cookie for us, and it saves it in the browser/client.
 * IT SAVES THE SESSION DATA ONCE AGAIN THE CLIENT SIDE/BROWSER
 * IT IS LIMITED TO 4000 BYTES =)
 *
 * If we have light-weight app, that does not have a DB then we can go with cookie-session
